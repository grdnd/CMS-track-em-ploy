# Homework 12: Employee Tracker with SQL

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

Track-Em allows non-developers to access and manipulate employee data stored in a MySQL database straight from the command line. With this application, you can view all your employees, sort them by their department or manager, add/delete roles, and change departments just to name a few features. This is what we call a `Content Managing System (CMS)` and ours is built with various technologies such as:

`Node.js | Inquirer.js | JavaScript | MySQL`

## Installation

If you would like to install this application, we can start by installing our node dependencies.

This can be done by simply running: `npm i` or `npm install console.table inquirer mysql2` to download our packages manually.

Once this process has completed, you're all set!

## Usage

To use this application, we can utilize our `npm start` script, which is simply `node index.js`.

Create a database in `MySQL` and call it `employee_db` where we will be storing all of our seed data.

From there, users will be presented with a list of choices generated by `node inquirer`.

When our data has successfully seeded, the command line will now run your designated commands as you set up your perfect team management system!
